I’d never play hide and seek with you because someone like you is impossible to find
On a scale of 1 to 10, you’re a 9. I’m the 1 you need.
Do you have a name or can I call you mine?
You may fall from the sky, you may fall from a tree, but the best way to fall… is in love with me.
Can I follow you? Cause my mom told me to follow my dreams
I sneezed because God blessed me with you.
I hope you know CPR, because you take my breath away!
If nothing lasts forever, will you be my nothing?
Me without you is like a nerd without braces, A shoe without laces, aSentenceWithoutSpaces.
If you stood in front of a mirror and help up 11 roses, you would see 12 of the most beautiful things in the world.
How is your fever? [What fever?] Oh… you just look hot to me.
See these keys? I wish I had the one to your heart.
I must be dancing with the devil, because you’re hot as hell.
There is something wrong with my cell phone. It doesn’t have your number in it.
I never need to see the sun again because your eyes light up my world.
Can I have your picture so I can show Santa what I want for Christmas?
Let’s commit the perfect crime: I’ll steal you’re heart, and you’ll steal mine.
